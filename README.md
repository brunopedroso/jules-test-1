Initial prompt:
```
I want to build a react app from scratch that allows me to create a music repertoire repository.

it should allow me add new musics and navigating between them. A music should have a title, an open text content and tags. Tags should be the main factor for navigating the musics list.

Navigation should happen like: I choose one existing tag, it lists me the music titles with that tag and the other tags associated with each music. If I click on one of the other tags in one other music it adds it up to a filter (which is shown above) which is applied. I can also remove tags from the filter.
